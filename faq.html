                    <p>The Bitcoin Cash hard fork resulted in the creation of multiple chains. However, since they are not protected by replay protection technology, it is possible to affect double spends on both chains (BCH/BSV or BCH/BCHA). This means that transactions made with one of the tokens can be copied to the other.</p>
                    <p>In this case, please contact our support team through online customer service. We will do our best to refund you within 24 hours. Nonetheless, we must warn you that in some extremely rare circumstances, there may be no chance of getting your funds back. The best way to avoid this is to split your coins: make sure you do this before arranging the transaction.</p>

                    <h3>KYC (Know Your Customer Rules) / AML (Anti-Money Laundering Rules) Procedures</h3>
                    <p>CCE Cash's AML/KYC procedures are supported by an automated risk prevention system. If a transaction is flagged as suspicious by the system, the transaction will be suspended and the customer will then be asked to confirm their identity.</p>
                    <p>The system uses a set of standards; however, they cannot be made public, otherwise someone would try to abuse these standards to trick the algorithm.</p>
                    <p>The system has proven to be very useful against money launderers and scammers, as the KYC process allows us to quickly distinguish honest customers from scammers without any problems.</p>
                    <p>Each KYC case is handled individually. If a customer is eligible for the program, but their transaction is flagged as suspicious, they will be notified via a pop-up notification after the exchange is submitted and asked to contact the support team.</p>
                    <p>CCE Cash works with a KYC provider called SumSub. In order to verify your identity, you can click on SumSub's link (located below the "Verify" button) and complete the verification through a comfortable and smooth UI. You will have 3 days to complete the verification process, and if you do not want to pass KYC, you can refuse (In this case, send a message to the support team at https://t.me/mixingbt) and get a refund.</p>
                    <p>After CCE Cash receives the following materials, the exchange is completed, and then the exchanged funds are sent to the designated recipient wallet address.</p>
                    <p>We do our best to maintain our reputation as a law-abiding exchange service that anyone can use safely, whether infrequently crypto trading or experienced traders; therefore, CCE Cash reserves the right to apply KYC/AML procedures to certain customers, wallet addresses, and selected assets.</p>

                    <p>If the customer for some reason does not want to disclose their identity and refuses to provide documents, the KYC/AML procedure will treat the transaction as failed and then return the deposited funds to the deposit address, minus network fees within 24 hours. CCE Cash reserves the right to blacklist this address, thereby disqualifying online deposits.</p>
                    <p>If the customer submits fake documents, the KYC/AML procedure will treat the transaction as failed and then return the deposited funds to the deposit address, minus network fees within 24 hours.
